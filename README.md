# Next.js Smart Contract Lottery

This page allows users to participate with a small amount of ETH in an automated Lottery! The winner is picked using the Chainlink VRF service, and picks a random user which gets all the contract's funds. Chainlink Keepers helps check if enough time has passed in order to pick a winner!

Please note that this only works on the hardhat network for now.
